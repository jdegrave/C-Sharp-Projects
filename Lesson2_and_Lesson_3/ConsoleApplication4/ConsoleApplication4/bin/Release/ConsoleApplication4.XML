            <summary>
            This main method explores "if" statements, ternary if statements, for loops, while loops (pre-test loop), do-while loops (post-test loop),
            and the use of "break" and/or "continue" statements.

            <remarks> 
            Since this is an excercise in control structures, the code here is not as efficient as it could be;
            for example, using the mod(modulus) operator) instead of a step (increment) of += 2.
